# task-board-app

## Description

This is task board that can be used to list visually tasks that need to be completed.  It allows for the user to create tasks and include a title, description and a due-date.  It then allows users to place tasks in one of 3 columns: to do, in progress and done.  When a task is within 24 hours of its due date, the task card will turn yelloe.  If the task is past due, the card will turn red.  All completed items will turn green when placed in the "Done" column.  Furthermore, tasks will be saved in the space they were dropped after refreshing.
